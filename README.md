# SQL Data Analytics Project  
### Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL data analytics workflow, covering *data cleaning* and *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* on a real-world dataset.  
The objective is to transform raw data into clean, structured data and extract meaningful business insights using SQL.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible)
- GitHub

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
In this phase, raw data was prepared for analysis by performing:
- Removal of duplicate records
- Handling of NULL and missing values
- Standardization of text and date formats
- Correction of inconsistent and invalid data
- Ensuring data integrity and quality

📁 Folder: Data_Cleaning

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning the data, exploratory analysis was performed to uncover insights such as:
- Trend and pattern identification
- Aggregations and summary statistics
- Key performance metrics (KPIs)
- Business-relevant insights derived from SQL queries

📁 Folder: Data_Exploration

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into separate folders to clearly represent each stage of the SQL analytics workflow:

- *Data_Cleaning* → Contains SQL scripts used to clean, standardize, and prepare raw data for analysis  
- *Data_Exploration* → Contains SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis and insight generation  
- *README.md* → Provides an overview of the project, tools used, and outcomes

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Writing efficient and readable SQL queries
- Cleaning messy real-world datasets
- Performing exploratory analysis using SQL
- Structuring analytics projects professionally on GitHub

---

## 🚀 Outcome
This project highlights my ability to handle data from raw form to insight generation using SQL, following best practices suitable for entry-level Data Analyst roles.
